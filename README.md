# Welcome to the Strengthening the Reporting of Empirical Simulation Studies (STRESS) Guidelines pages #

## Why STRESS? ##

*We need to improve how we report and publish simulation studies*

Incomplete or ambiguous reporting means that many simulation studies are not reproducible, leaving other modellers with an incomplete picture of what has been done and unable to judge the reliability of the results. Crucially, unclear reporting makes it difficult to reproduce or reuse findings.

In response to this we developed STRESS to help to improve the reporting of discrete-event simulation, system dynamics and agent-based simulation models. 

We hope that STRESS can help to improve reproducibility of simulation results and to help modellers compose and structure Data Management Plans reflecting the broader aspects of simulation. 

## Latest versions of the STRESS Guidelines (v1_1) ##

The latest versions of the STRESS Guidelines are as follows:

- STRESS for Discrete Event Simulation (STRESS_DES_V1_1.docx)

- STRESS for Agent Based Simulation (STRESS_ABS_V1_1.docx)

- STRESS for Systems Dynamics (STRESS_SD_V1_1.docx)

You can download all of the above from our [Github Repository](https://github.com/stressguidelines/stress-guides/) (Click on the filename in the repository and then click on the download on the right)

*Reproducibility is one aspect of Open Science.  This introductory tutorial paper shows how one could take an Open Science approach to documenting data, models, results, people and even Science Gatewats in an acadmic paper.  It's a good template to use if you are interested.*
