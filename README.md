# Welcome to the Strengthening the Reporting of Empirical Simulation Studies (STRESS) Guidelines pages #

## Latest versions of the STRESS Guidelines (v1_1) ##

The latest versions of the STRESS Guidelines are as follows:

- STRESS for Discrete Event Simulation (STRESS_DES_V1_1.docx)

- STRESS for Agent Based Simulation (STRESS_ABS_V1_1.docx)

- STRESS for Systems Dynamics (STRESS_SD_V1_1.docx)

You can download all of the above from our [Github Repository](https://github.com/stressguidelines/stress-guides/) (Click on the filename in the repository and then click on the download on the right)

Please feel free to suggest modifications or even new STRESS Guidelines (e.g. for hybrid simulation) - [contact us](mailto:stressguides@gmail.com).

*Reproducibility is one aspect of Open Science.  This introductory tutorial paper shows how one could take an Open Science approach to documenting data, models, results, people and even Science Gatewats in an acadmic paper.  It's a good template to use if you are interested.*
